# My Projects 🚀

## 🔹 Project 1: TTC Next Bus 🚌⏰
**Description:**  TTC provides a text messaging service where users can enter a bus stop code to receive real-time arrival information for upcoming buses. This service relies on Google’s transit schedules and TTC data.
For my project, I would develop a web-based version where users enter the time and bus stop code to retrieve the next bus arrival times. Instead of real-time data integration, I could simulate schedules by hardcoding different bus frequencies based on peak and off-peak hours for one or two bus stops. I have attached a screenshot of how the current text service works for reference.


## 🔹 Project 2: Tea Maker ☕🫖
**Description:** The user answers a few basic questions, such as:
Number of cups of tea required
Preferred consistency (thick with more milk, normal with half milk and half water)
Strength of brew (strong or light, adjusting the quantity of tea leaves)
Sugar quantity and additional condiments (e.g., saffron, ginger, cardamom)
Based on the user's responses, the program generates a complete recipe, including ingredient quantities and the time required to prepare the tea. It also alerts the user when the tea is ready.
